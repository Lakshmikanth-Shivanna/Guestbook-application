Adding a Redis Chart dependency Chart dependencies are used to install other chartsâ€™ resources that a Helm chart may depend on.

In this example, we are using Redis as a database so we to need add this as a dependency.

First we can search the charts for redis using the below command:

helm search hub redis

Now we will add the dependency section in the Charts.yaml file as shown below:

dependencies:

- name: redis 
  version: 12.7.x
  repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
How to download this dependency?

When downloading a dependency for the first time, you should use the helm dependency update command.

This command will download your dependency to the charts/ directory and will generate the Chart.lock file, which specifies metadata about the chart that was downloaded.

helm dependency update guestbook

Now you should see that it has downloaded the dependency and also updated the Chart.lock file
